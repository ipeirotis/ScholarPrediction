We present a technique for predicting the future performance of academic scholars. Our method models each scholar as a two dimensional sequence, one dimension capturing the production of individual publications from the scholar and the second dimension captures the impact of each publication over time. Based on our model, we present a predictive method that estimates the lifetime potential of each scholar. Using a comprehensive data set that contains faculty members from the top-20 universities in the US, across all fields, we demonstrate that our model can predict with high accuracy the future career trajectories of scholars, even in a 30-year horizon.
