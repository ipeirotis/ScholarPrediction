\section{Experiments}
\subsection{Data Source}
We perform the researcher future citation prediction on the Google Scholar database.
It covers *** publications by *** researchers for more than 50 years.
The total number of citations is roughly *** in this data set.

We used all papers with cross validation to formulate the publication level future citation prediction model.
With this model we created a new feature that aggregates all the number of citation predicted from all papers a researcher published before year $t$.

For each researcher who has been active for at least $\Delta t$ years, we generate a new record in a new data set for each year after the first $\Delta t$ years, i.e. if a researcher has been active for 40 years and $\Delta t=5$. 35 records are generated for every year after five years in the field. 

Since our work is time independent, therefore, we randomly split the data with 50\% for training, 20\% validation and another 30\% for test. 

We compare our predicted future citations with actual future citations in the test set.

\subsection{Evaluation}
The coefficient of determination ($R^2$) is used in evaluating how well prediction model fits the test data.
The definition of $R^2$ is:
\[R^2=\frac{\sum_{r \in }\hat{D_c}(r,t,\Delta t)-\bar{D_c}}{}\]
where $\hat{D_c}$ is the predicted future citation for researcher $r$ in year $t$, 
and $\bar{D_c}$ represents the mean of the actual citations from year $t$ to $t+\Delta t$ for all researchers.

By definition, $R^2\in [0,1]$, with $R^2=0$ means the predicted citations does not fit the actual citations at all,
and $R^2=1$ means the model perfectly predicted the future citations. A model with a larger $R^2$ indicates a better prediction performance and is therefore desired. 
\subsection{Prediction Performance}
Following Yan et al.'s work, our prediction model for publication future citation is summarized in table \ref{tbl-pubprediction}.

\input{table/publicationprediction}

The prediction for researcher future citations is summarized in table \ref{tbl-r2}.
The best predictive performance for next five year researcher citations is plotted in figure \ref{researcher-prediction}.

\subsubsection{Variance in Prediction}
As we can see, most of the variance in our predictive model are having a higher predicted future citations than actual. This may result from unpredictable situations, for example, the retirement of a researcher. 

Sidiropoulos et al. reported that h-index has shortcomings in what majorly of its inability to distinguish active and inactive(retired) researchers\cite{sidiropoulos2007generalized}. The higher h-index contributes as a positive factor in our prediction and results in a higher prediction. In our work this also reflects the potential lack of knowledge of the recent status of researchers.
{\sc still need explanation.}

\subsubsection{Citation Distribution}
As is shown in figure \ref{researcher-prediction}, the distribution of future researchers citations shows a long tail. 
Most researchers gets a total future citations less than 2,500 cites.
