\section{Regression Models}

\subsection{Linear Regression}
Linear Regression is an approach for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable $y$ and explanatory variables $X$ in a scalar way. A linear regression result has an equation of the following form, $Y = AX +b$. In this paper, researcher features are treated as explanatory variables and future citation counts are considered as dependent variable.
\subsection{Decision Forest Regression}
\subsection{Poisson Regression}
\subsection{LASSO and Ridge Regression}
Regularized linear regression prevents model from over fitting on noisy data sets\cite{}.
