\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we present a publication level approach for researcher future citations(PLRFC) prediction, which predicts the future total citations for a researcher. 
Our works will also cast some light for predicting the future scholar performance of a researcher.

Our predictive model will fully discover the publication and researcher data set. 

Given a certain researcher and its corresponding features relevant with citation patterns (such as the organization of this researcher, indexes for evaluating the scholar performance etc.), PLRFC predicts the citation counts of all publications of this researcher in the next few years. We formally formulate PLRFC task as a learning problem based on multiple regression models.
Finally, PLRFC prediction model is evaluated by the coefficient of determination ($R^2$).

PLRFC is a two step prediction model. We first formulated a model for publication future citation prediction and utilized this model to generate a new feature of a researcher as the sum of all predicted future citations for all publication of this researcher.
