\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we present a publication level feature for researcher future citations count prediction problem, which predicts the future citation counts for a researcher. 
Our works also cast some light for predicting the future scholar performance of a researcher.

Our predictive model will fully discover the publication and researcher data set. 

Given a certain researcher and its corresponding features relevant with citation patterns (such as the organization of this researcher, indexes for evaluating the scholar performance etc.), PLRFC predicts the citation counts of all publications of this researcher in the next few years. We formally formulate PLRFC task as a learning problem based on multiple regression models. PLRFC prediction model is evaluated by the coefficient of determination ($R^2$).

PLRFC is a two step prediction model. We first formulated a model for publication future citation prediction and utilized this model to generate a new feature of a researcher as the sum of all predicted future citations for all publication of this researcher. 

PLRFC help the model perform better from a coefficient of determination from 0.798 to 0.957 with Random Forest regression model. It utilized latent factors of author and publication relations and give a prediction based on this relation.
